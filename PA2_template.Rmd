## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Loading and preprocessing the data

Activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", na.strings = "NA")

# Loading libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(lubridate)

## Taking a look...
head(Activity)
summary(Activity)
str(Activity)

## Converting “date” variable into a classe and the “interval” variable into a factor
Activity$date <- ymd(Activity$date)
Activity$interval <- factor(Activity$interval)


# What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

## Subsetting the data, ignoring the NA values
Activity_no_NA <- filter(Activity, !is.na(steps))

## Agreggate the steps taken by day
steps_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data= Activity_no_NA, sum)

# 1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(steps_day$steps, breaks = 20, col = "green", xlab = "Steps per Day", main= "Total number of steps taken per day")

# 2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
mean(steps_day$steps)
median(steps_day$steps)


# What is the average daily activity pattern?

## Calculating the average of the 5 minute interval
steps_interval <- aggregate(Activity_no_NA$steps, by=list(interval=Activity_no_NA$interval), FUN=mean)

# Adding columns names
colnames(steps_interval) <- c("interval", "average_steps")

# 1. Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
plot(levels(steps_interval$interval), steps_interval$average_steps, type="l",
     xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Average Steps", main = "Average Daily Activity Pattern",  col ="green")

# 2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
max_step <-max(steps_interval$average_steps)
max_step

max_step_5min_interval <- steps_interval[which.max(steps_interval$average_steps),]$interval
max_step_5min_interval


# Imputing missing values

# 1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
sum(is.na(as.character(Activity$steps)))

# 2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset
Fill.Activity <- Activity
Missing.activity <- is.na(Fill.Activity$steps)
Mean.interval <- tapply(Fill.Activity$steps, Fill.Activity$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=TRUE)

# 3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in
Fill.Activity$steps[Missing.activity] <- Mean.interval[as.character(Fill.Activity$interval[Missing.activity])]

# 4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
## Creating a data frame with the steps taken for each day
Steps.EachDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = Fill.Activity, sum)

## Histogram
hist(Steps.EachDay$steps, breaks = 20, col = "green", xlab = "Number of Steps", main= "Total number of steps taken each day")


# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

# 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend"
## Creating a factor variable "day "to store the day of the week:
Fill.Activity$day <- as.factor(weekdays(Fill.Activity$date))

## Creating a logical variable "is_weekday" (weekday=TRUE, weekend = FALsE)
Fill.Activity$is_weekday <- ifelse((!Fill.Activity$day %in% c("sábado","domingo")), TRUE, FALSE)

## Calculating the average number of steps for weekdays
Weekdays <- Fill.Activity[Fill.Activity$is_weekday,]
Steps_per_interval_weekdays <- aggregate(Weekdays$steps, by=list(interval=Weekdays$interval), FUN=mean)

## Calculating the average number of steps for weekends
Weekends <- Fill.Activity[!Fill.Activity$is_weekday,]
Steps_per_interval_weekends <- aggregate(Weekends$steps, by=list(interval=Weekends$interval), FUN=mean)

## Adding columns names and to indicate the day
colnames(Steps_per_interval_weekdays) <- c("interval", "average_steps")
colnames(Steps_per_interval_weekends) <- c("interval", "average_steps")

Steps_per_interval_weekdays$day <- "Weekday"
Steps_per_interval_weekends$day <- "Weekend"

## Merging Data
Week_data <- rbind(Steps_per_interval_weekends, Steps_per_interval_weekdays)
## Converting the day variabke to a factor
Week_data$day <- as.factor(Week_data$day)

#Making the plot
library(lattice)
xyplot(average_steps ~  interval | day, data = Week_data, layout = c(1,2), type ="l", ylab="Number of Steps")
